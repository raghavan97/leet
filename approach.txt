# 1
 Traverse the array of integers num and make a presence dict indicating
 the presence of the number, if the counterpart is already present, then
 we return the two indexes

# 2
 iterate l1 and l2 simultaneously , using pointer p1 and p2 respectively
 if there is no element in any one of the list then imagine a 0
 add the individual numbers and if carry is found use the carry
 once both p1 and p2 have reached end , then stop

# 3
 Sliding Window
 with 2 pointers , left and right , we look at a substring and see if it has
 repeats
 when there is a repeat, then we move the left by one
 when there is no repeat , we move the right
 we also check a substring only if it is longer than what already have
